### Requirements
* A Raspberry Pi 2, 3 or 3+
* A microSD card with an OS already up and running ([OSMC](https://osmc.tv/download/) is suggested)

Make sure you have [Hyperion](https://hyperion-project.org) installed and configured (installation and configuration via [HyperCon](https://hyperion-project.org/wiki/HyperCon-Information) is suggested).


## üíæ Installation
* Open a terminal window on your Raspberry Pi or connect via SSH (use the Terminal app on MacOS/Linux, or download [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org) on Windows) and run this command to clone this repository on your device:
```shell
cd ~/ && sudo apt-get install git && git clone https://github.com/JFtechOfficial/ultimate-ambilght-setup.git
```
 * Prepare the download.sh and install.sh scripts:
```shell
sudo chmod 775 ~/ultimate-ambilight-setup/install.sh
sudo chmod 775 ~/ultimate-ambilight-setup/download.sh
```
* You can decide what to download using the `-a`, `-b`, `-c` and `-f` arguments (no custom installation arguments means "install everything").
```shell
Options:
    General options:
        -h --help           Show this screen.
        -v --version        Show version.
    Custom download options:
        -a --assistant      download Google Assistant script.
        -b --buttons        download buttons script.
        -c --clock          download clock effect.
        -f --fan            download fan script.
```

* Run the `download.sh` script:
```shell
sudo ~/ultimate-ambilight-setup/./download.sh
```

* Now you can [configure](#Ô∏è-configuration) any .json files you would like to install. You can fin them in the directories: `Hyperion effects`, `buttons`, `Google_Assistant`and `fan`. You can decide what to install/reinstall using the `-a`, `-b`, `-c` and `-f` arguments (no custom installation arguments means "install everything").
```shell
Options:
    General options:
        -h --help           Show this screen.
        -v --version        Show version.
    Custom installation options:
        -a --assistant      Install Google Assistant script.
        -b --buttons        Install buttons script.
        -c --clock          Install clock effect.
        -f --fan            Install fan script.
```

* Once the [configuration step](#Ô∏è-configuration) is completed, run the `install.sh` script:
```shell
sudo ~/ultimate-ambilight-setup/./install.sh
```


## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
You can configure all the .json files you want to install before the execution of the `install.sh` script.
You can also change any configuration value after the [installation](#-installation) process. If you do, please remember to reboot your device afterwards
```shell
sudo reboot
```

### Clock Effect
* Get [your OpenWeatherMap API key](http://openweathermap.org/appid) 
* Open the `clock.json` file:
```shell
sudo nano ~/ultimate-ambilight-setup/Hyperion_effects/clock.json
```
* Modify the `owmAPIkey` value pasting your API key (you can use the same API key in the Kodi Weather app)
* Get [your coordinates](https://www.whataremycoordinates.com/) 
* Modify both `latitude` and `longitude` values pasting your own latitude and longitude
* Modify the `offset` value to match your LED setup
* Modify the `direction` value to match your LED setup ( `0` -> clockwise, `1` -> counterclockwise)
* You can modify the default colors and widths of the "virutal" clock hands and/or add markers
* Save `Ctrl + X` and close `Enter` the file
* If you want to modify the `clock.json` file after the installation you can find it in the Hyperion effects directory:
```shell
sudo nano /usr/share/hyperion/effects/clock.json
```
*(example with the default path)*

### Buttons
* Open the `buttons.json` file:
```shell
nano ~/ultimate-ambilight-setup/buttons/buttons.json
```
* Modify the `effects` and `clear` values to match your GPIO setup. Avoid using pin 5 (BOARD) a.k.a. GPIO 3 (BCM): it's already been hardcoded for you as power button ;)
* Save `Ctrl + X` and close `Enter` the file
### Fan
* Open the `fan.json` file:
```shell
nano ~/ultimate-ambilight-setup/fan/fan.json
```
* Modify the `pin` value to match your GPIO setup
* You can modify the default `max_TEMP` value (temperature in Celsius after which the fan triggers),
`cutoff_TEMP` value (temerature in Celsius after which the fan stops) and `sleepTime` value (temperature reading interval in seconds)
* Save `Ctrl + X` and close `Enter` the file

### Google Assistant
* Open the `client.json` file:
```shell
nano ~/ultimate-ambilight-setup/Google_Assistant/client.json
```
* Modify the `ip_address` value of the `hyperion_server` to match the IP address of the device running Hyperion ("127.0.0.1" if it's the same device running this script)
* If you used a different port you can modify the default `port` value of the `hyperion_server`
* Create an [Adafruit-IO](https://io.adafruit.com/) account
* Create an "effect launching" topic and an "effect clearing" topic (Feeds)
* Modify the `username` and `key` values of the `adafruit_mqtt_broker` to match your Adafruit-IO username and AIO key
* Modify the `effect-topic` value of the `adafruit_mqtt_broker` to match the name of your Adafruit-IO "effect launching" topic
* Modify the `other-topic` value of the `adafruit_mqtt_broker` to match the name of your Adafruit-IO "effect clearing" topic
* Modify the `ip_address` value of the `kodi_server` to match the IP address of the device running Kodi ("127.0.0.1" if it's the same device running this script)
* Modify the `video_uri` value of the `kodi_server` to the local path or internet link of the video you want to play (supported: YouTube, Dropbox, Flickr, GoogleDrive, Reddit, Twitch:video, Vimeo, VK and many more)
* Save `Ctrl + X` and close `Enter` the file


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Use your favorite [Hyperion client](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.hyperion.hyperionfree&hl=en_US) to select and run the clock effect: the second hand has a warmer color when outside is hot and it has a colder color when outside is cold.

Use buttons connected to the GPIO to launch your predefined effects, go back to the capture mode, or safely turn off the Raspberry Pi.

Use a fan connected to the GPIO: it will automatically start to spin when the CPU is above the `max_TEMP` threshold and will automatically stop when the CPU is below the `cutoff_TEMP` threshold.

Use [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) to interface Google Assistant with the Adafruit-IO mqtt broker. You can send:
* to the "effect launching" topic *(the same topic assigned to* `effect-topic` *earlier)*
   * an effect name in order to activate that effect 
* to the "effect clearing" topic *(the same topic assigned to* `other-topic` *earlier)*
   * `OFF` in order to turn any effect off (goes back to capture mode)
   * `ON` in order to turn on the `Dim cinema lights` effect (additional way to turn this effect on)
   * `PLAY` in order to play the video from `video_uri` while turning any effect off (goes back to capture mode)
   * `STOP` in order to stop any video

Now you can use the Google Assistant on your smartphone/tablet/Google Home to tell Hyperion what to do.

## üí≠ FAQ

> Can I use the same GPIO pin for the configuration of two different scripts?

No. You should never use the same pin for different tasks at the same time (e.g. controlling the fan and reading the state of a button from the same pin at the same time will not work and could break your Raspberry Pi).

> Can I install the Google Assistant client script on a Raspberry Pi different from the one running Hyperion?

Yes. You can run it on any unix machine connected to the same local network: it will send commands to the Raspberry Pi that runs Hyperion. The fan script, buttons script and the clock effect cannot be used in the same way: you must install them on the machine that you intend to use them on.
