### Requirements
* A Raspberry Pi 2 or 3
* A microSD card with an OS installed ([OSMC](https://osmc.tv/download/) is suggested)

You can install and configure [hyperion](https://hyperion-project.org) now or after the installation step (installation and configuration via [HyperCon](https://hyperion-project.org/wiki/HyperCon-Information) is suggested).


## üíæ Installation
Open a terminal window on your Raspberry Pi or connect via SSH (use the Terminal app on MacOS/Linux, download [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org) on Windows) and run this command:
```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JFtechOfficial/ultimate-ambilght-setup/master/install.sh
```
 It will download the `install.sh` file. You can now modify the install.sh file if you don't want to install all the scripts

```shell
sudo chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```
If something goes wrong, please manually install all the [dependancies](#Ô∏è-credits) and clone this repository using the commands below:
```shell
sudo apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/JFtechOfficial/ultimate-ambilght-setup.git
mkdir -p /home/osmc/
mv -i ultimate-ambilght-setup/ /home/osmc/Development/
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Be sure to have [hyperion](https://hyperion-project.org) installed and configured.

### Clock effect
* Move both `clock.py` and `clock.json` to the Hyperion effects folder (I'm using the hyperion default path)
```shell
sudo mv clock.* /usr/share/hyperion/effects/
```
* Get [your OpenWeatherMap API key](http://openweathermap.org/appid) 
* Open the `clock.json` file
```shell
sudo nano /usr/share/hyperion/effects/clock.json
```
* Paste the key in the `clock.json` file (you can use the same key in the kodi weather app)
* Get [your coordinates](https://support.google.com/maps/answer/18539?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en&oco=1) 
* Paste both latitude and longitude in the `clock.json` file
* You can modify the default colors of the "virutal" clock hands and add markers
* Save and close the file

### Buttons
* Open the `buttons.py` file
```shell
nano /home/osmc/Development/buttons.py
```
* Modify the `Pins` and `clear` variables to match your GPIO setup
* Save and close the file

### Fan
* Open the `fan.py` file
```shell
nano /home/osmc/Development/fan.py
```
* Modify the `pin` variable to match your GPIO setup
* You can modify the default `max_TEMP` variable (Temperature in Celsius after which the fan triggers),
`cutoff_TEMP` variable (Temerature in Celsius after which the fan stops) and `sleepTime` variable (Temperature reading interval in seconds) or you can activate one of the pre-made fan profile by uncommenting it
* Save and close the file


Remember to reboot your device after the configuration
```shell
sudo reboot
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Use your favorite Hyperion client to select and run the clock effect, the second hand has a warmer color if outside is warm and it has a colder color if outside is cold.

Use buttons connected to the GPIO to launch a predefined hyperion effects, go back to the default mode, or safely turn off the Raspberry Pi.

The fan script requires you to do nothing, it's automated.

The `hyperion.config.json` file is an example of a working configuration file for hyperion (generated via [HyperCon](https://github.com/hyperion-project/hypercon))
