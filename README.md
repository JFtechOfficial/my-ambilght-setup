</details>

### Requirements
* A Raspberry Pi 2, 3 or 3+
* A microSD card with an OS already up and running ([OSMC](https://osmc.tv/download/) is suggested)

Make sure you have [Hyperion](https://hyperion-project.org) installed and configured (installation and configuration via [HyperCon](https://hyperion-project.org/wiki/HyperCon-Information) is suggested).


## üíæ Installation
* Open a terminal window on your Raspberry Pi or connect via SSH (use the Terminal app on MacOS/Linux, or download [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org) on Windows) and run this command to clone this repository on your device:
```shell
cd ~/ && sudo apt-get install git && git clone https://github.com/JFtechOfficial/ultimate-ambilght-setup.git
```

* Run the `download.sh` script to download/update all the other scripts:
```shell
sudo chmod 775 ~/ultimate-ambilight-setup/download.sh
sudo ~/ultimate-ambilight-setup/./download.sh
```

* Now you can [configure](#Ô∏è-configuration) any .json file you would like to install. You can find them in the following directories: `Hyperion_effects`, `buttons`, `Google_Assistant`and `fan`. You can decide what to install/reinstall using the `-a`, `-b`, `-c` and `-f` arguments (no custom installation arguments means "install everything").
```shell
Options:
    General options:
        -h --help           Show this screen.
        -v --version        Show version.
    Custom installation options:
        -a --assistant      Install Google Assistant script.
        -b --buttons        Install buttons script.
        -c --clock          Install clock effect.
        -f --fan            Install fan script.
```

* Once the [configuration step](#Ô∏è-configuration) is completed, run the `install.sh` script:
```shell
sudo chmod 775 ~/ultimate-ambilight-setup/install.sh
sudo ~/ultimate-ambilight-setup/./install.sh
```


## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
You can configure all the .json files you want to install before the execution of the `install.sh` script.
You can also change any configuration value after the [installation](#-installation) process. If you do, please remember to reboot your device afterwards
```shell
sudo reboot
```

### Clock Effect
* Open the `clock.json` file:
```shell
sudo nano ~/ultimate-ambilight-setup/Hyperion_effects/clock.json
```
* Get [your OpenWeatherMap API key](http://openweathermap.org/appid) 
* Modify the `owmAPIkey` value pasting your API key (you can use the same API key in the Kodi Weather app)
* Get [your coordinates](https://www.whataremycoordinates.com/) 
* Modify both `latitude` and `longitude` values pasting your own latitude and longitude
* Modify the `offset` value to match your LED setup
* Modify the `direction` value to match your LED setup ( `0` -> clockwise, `1` -> counterclockwise)
* You can modify the default colors and widths of the "virutal" clock hands and/or add markers
* Save `Ctrl + X` and close `Enter` the file
* If you want to modify the `clock.json` file after the installation you can find it in the Hyperion effects directory:
```shell
sudo nano /usr/share/hyperion/effects/clock.json
```
*(example with the default path)*

### Buttons
* Open the `buttons.json` file:
```shell
nano ~/ultimate-ambilight-setup/buttons/buttons.json
```
* Modify the pins values to match your GPIO setup. Avoid using pin 5 (BOARD) a.k.a. GPIO 3 (BCM): it's already been hardcoded for you as power button ;)
* Modify the `short-press` and `long-press` values for each pin. You can assign an effect name (e.g. `"Rainbow swirl"`) to launch the effect, an RGB value (e.g.:`[255,255,255]`) to launch the color, the string `"clear"` to go back to the default capture mode, or `null` to do nothing. I suggest you not modify: 
```
{
"short-press" : "clear",
"long-press" : [0,0,0]
}
```
* You can add as many buttons as you want by pasting the following code after `gpio-setup: {` :
```json
"*Pin*" :
{
    "short-press" : *"effect"/[255,255,255]/null*,
    "long-press" : *"effect"/[255,255,255]/null*
},
```

* Modify the `gpio-mode` value to match the pin numbering you're using ("BCM"/"BOARD")
* Save `Ctrl + X` and close `Enter` the file

### Fan
* Open the `fan.json` file:
```shell
nano ~/ultimate-ambilight-setup/fan/fan.json
```
* Modify the `pin` value to match your GPIO setup
* Modify the `gpio-mode` value to match the pin numbering you're using ("BCM"/"BOARD")
* You can modify the other values to make sure your fan is working as intended
* Save `Ctrl + X` and close `Enter` the file

### Google Assistant
* Open the `client.json` file:
```shell
nano ~/ultimate-ambilight-setup/Google_Assistant/client.json
```
* Modify the `ip_address` value of the `hyperion_server` to match the IP address of the device running Hyperion ("127.0.0.1" if it's the same device running this script)
* If you used a different port you can modify the default `port` value of the `hyperion_server`
* Create an [Adafruit-IO](https://io.adafruit.com/) account
* Create an "effect launching" topic, a "color launching" topic and an "effect clearing" topic (Feeds)
* Modify the `username` and `key` values of the `mqtt_broker` to match your Adafruit-IO username and AIO key
* Modify the `effect-topic` value of the `mqtt_broker` to match the name of your Adafruit-IO "effect launching" topic
* Modify the `color-topic` value of the `mqtt_broker` to match the name of your Adafruit-IO "color launching" topic
* Modify the `other-topic` value of the `mqtt_broker` to match the name of your Adafruit-IO "effect clearing" topic
* Modify the `ip_address` value of the `kodi_server` to match the IP address of the device running Kodi ("127.0.0.1" if it's the same device running this script)
* Modify the `video_uri` value of the `kodi_server` to the local path or internet link of the video you want to play (supported: YouTube, Dropbox, Flickr, GoogleDrive, Reddit, Twitch:video, Vimeo, VK and many more)
* Get [your Yandex API key](https://translate.yandex.com/developers/keys) (skip if you use English as main language)
* Modify the `API_key` value with the Yandex API key (skip if you use English as main language)
* Modify the `from_language` value to match your language
* You can add custom actions by pasting the following code after `"custom_actions": [` :
```json
{
"message": "*your_message*", 
"target": *"effect"/[255,255,255]/"clear"/null*
},
```
* Save `Ctrl + X` and close `Enter` the file


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Use your favorite [Hyperion client](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.hyperion.hyperionfree&hl=en_US) to select and run the clock effect: the second hand has a warmer color when outside is hot and it has a colder color when outside is cold.

Use buttons connected to the GPIO to launch effects or color, to go back to the capture mode, or safely turn off the Raspberry Pi.

Use a fan connected to the GPIO: it will automatically start to spin when the CPU is above the `max_TEMP` threshold and will automatically stop when the CPU is below the `cutoff_TEMP` threshold.

Use [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) to interface Google Assistant with the Adafruit-IO mqtt broker. You can send:
* to the "effect launching" topic *(the same topic assigned to* `effect-topic` *earlier)*
   * an effect name in order to activate that effect
* to the "color launching" topic *(the same topic assigned to* `color-topic` *earlier)*
   * a color name in order to activate that color 
* to the "effect clearing" topic *(the same topic assigned to* `other-topic` *earlier)*
   * `OFF` in order to turn any effect off (goes back to capture mode)
   * `ON` in order to turn on the lights
   * `PLAY` in order to play the video from `video_uri` while turning any effect off (goes back to capture mode)
   * `STOP` in order to stop any video

Now you can use the Google Assistant on your smartphone/tablet/Google Home to tell Hyperion what to do.

## üí≠ FAQ

> Can I use the same GPIO pin for the configuration of two different scripts?

No. You should never use the same pin for different tasks at the same time (e.g. controlling the fan and reading the state of a button from the same pin at the same time will not work and could break your Raspberry Pi).

> Can I install the Google Assistant client script on a Raspberry Pi different from the one running Hyperion?

Yes. You can run it on any unix machine connected to the same local network: it will send commands to the Raspberry Pi that runs Hyperion. The fan script, buttons script and the clock effect cannot be used in the same way: you must install them on the machine that you intend to use them on.
